# Farm Aid - Helping Farmers in Crop Harvesting

![Farm Aid Logo](https://i.ibb.co/S33JFx7/9.png)

## Introduction

Farm Aid is a web-based platform aimed at providing valuable assistance to farmers in their crop harvesting process. The platform offers three main facilities to farmers:

1. **Crop Recommendation**: Farm Aid leverages advanced algorithms to analyze soil properties and climate conditions to recommend the most suitable crops for cultivation. This feature helps farmers make informed decisions about what to grow on their farmland, increasing productivity and profitability.

2. **Disease Detection**: The platform employs cutting-edge image recognition technology to detect plant diseases by analyzing leaf images. It can accurately classify between 38 different diseases, allowing farmers to identify and address potential crop health issues early on, preventing widespread damage and loss.

3. **Fertilizer Recommendation**: Farm Aid provides personalized fertilizer recommendations based on the specific soil and climate characteristics of a farmer's land, along with the type of crop they are growing. This helps optimize nutrient supply, leading to healthier and more robust crop yields.

## How to Access Farm Aid

Farm Aid is a user-friendly web application accessible via any modern web browser. To use the platform, follow these simple steps:

1. Visit the Farm Aid website at [https://farmaid.onrender.com/](https://farmaid.onrender.com/).
2. Sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.
3. Once logged in, you will have access to the three main facilities: Crop Recommendation, Disease Detection, and Fertilizer Recommendation.

## Features

### 1. Crop Recommendation

The Crop Recommendation feature is based on a sophisticated analysis of soil properties and climate data. It takes into account factors such as soil pH, moisture content, temperature, and precipitation patterns to suggest the most suitable crops for the specific geographical location. Farmers can explore a wide range of crop options and select those that align with their preferences and long-term goals.

### 2. Disease Detection

Farm Aid's Disease Detection feature employs state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to analyze leaf images uploaded by farmers. By leveraging a vast database of plant diseases, the system can accurately detect and identify the presence of 38 different diseases. Early detection enables farmers to take timely action, preventing disease spread and minimizing crop losses.

### 3. Fertilizer Recommendation

The Fertilizer Recommendation feature combines soil analysis data with crop-specific requirements to generate personalized fertilizer recommendations. By considering the soil's nutrient levels, pH, and other relevant factors, Farm Aid suggests the optimal type and quantity of fertilizer to ensure the best possible crop growth and health.

## Technologies Used
Farm Aid is built using a combination of cutting-edge technologies, ensuring a seamless user experience and accurate results for farmers:

###TensorFlow and TensorFlow.js 
TensorFlow is a powerful open-source machine learning framework used for training and deploying machine learning models. TensorFlow.js extends TensorFlow's capabilities to the web, allowing the implementation of machine learning models directly in the browser for real-time processing of leaf images during disease detection.

###Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 
CNNs are deep learning models specifically designed for image recognition tasks. In Farm Aid's Disease Detection feature, CNNs play a vital role in analyzing leaf images to detect and classify various plant diseases accurately.

###Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) 
ANN is a fundamental component of the Crop Recommendation and Fertilizer Recommendation features. These networks are used to process and analyze soil and climate data, allowing the platform to suggest suitable crops and personalized fertilizer recommendations.

###Node.js
Farm Aid's backend is built using Node.js, a popular runtime environment for server-side JavaScript applications. Node.js enables efficient handling of user requests and seamless communication between the frontend and backend components.

###Bootstrap
The frontend of Farm Aid is designed using Bootstrap, a widely-used CSS framework that ensures responsive and visually appealing user interfaces across different devices and screen sizes.
